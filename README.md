# Map-Shortest-Path-Visualizer
It is a path visualizer for delivery of item on multiple locations. It shows two paths one random represented by Orange line and other using BFS algorithm (goes to next closest location by route) represented by Green line. It compares both the distances and displays the distance saved by following BFS path and the cost of fuel saved. Map rendering is done via tom-tom API and shortest path using Breath-first-Search Algorithm. The use case is that it will give shortest path which which use less time and fuel hence decreasing transport cost of the delivery company where multiple items are needed to be delivered in one go. It`s a single page web application made using React.js for frontend and Node.js for backed.
